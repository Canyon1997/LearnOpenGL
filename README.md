# About
Welcome to DaGrandRenderer! This is my first renderer created using openGL. Build instructions are below so you can run the project. Thank you very much for looking into this project, I hope you enjoy!

# How To Build
* This renderer uses openGL 3.3
* There are a number of 3rd party dependencies that will need to be built in order to use this project. All of the source files for each library are organized in the 'External' directory.
* The 'build' folder in the root directory has a number of directories within it to place your build files organized by library name. I used cmake to build each library and place the build location in each of the matching folders.
