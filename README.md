# LearnOpenGL
This repository contains all the different lessons from each section of learn open gl to track my progression of learning computer graphics

# PersonalNote
This repository is DEPRECATED. I am restarting LearnOpenGL because of the year I had working on my masters in computer science. I have been away for quite some time and feel it is best to restart LearnOpenGL to really grasp the fundamentals. This will all be contained in a different repository.
