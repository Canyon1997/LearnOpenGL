# LearnOpenGL
This repository contains all the different lessons from each section of learn open gl to track my progression of learning computer graphics

# PersonalNote
I decided to merge everything into one giant project as I didn't think about it before. The learning process of my computer graphics journey started in mid July up till now, learning almost every day. Because I merged the projects into one, my commit history has been deleted.
